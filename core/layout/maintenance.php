									<p><strong>Maurice Moss</strong>, who's name is commonly misconceived to be 'Maurice Mozz' , (born c. 1972 [3]) is an IT Expert. He is the most hard working of the staff in the IT Department, and is also the most experienced and the most capable of doing his job well. He puts a lot of effort into his job, however, he does not get the credit which he deserves. Like most of the department, he is ignored and disrespected by the employees who rank above him.</p>
									<p><h5><strong>Personality:</strong></h5>Moss is very hard-working, and is the driving force of the IT Department. He enjoys working with computers and puts the maximum amount of effort into his job.He has little social interaction with any one other than Roy and Jen and is often bullied and mocked by others. He is easily hurt and is extremely emotional, instantly bursting into tears whenever he is even mildly insulted. He has been described as a 'standard nerd' and a 'social pirannah'.</p>
									<p>Moss is extremely intelligent and is most experienced in chemistry, physics, technology, electronics, computing and mathematics. Despite his intelligence, Moss can be quite childish at times, having a children's astronaut-themed duvet, and can be extremely immature in social situations, where he may make rather ignorant comments. Despite this, he seems to be willing to talk to strangers without much hesitation.</p>
									<p>Moss, along with Roy, were briefly affected by Jen's menstrual cycle and became overly feminine for a time. Both of them also became even more emotional and Moss, after being unsuccesful in opening a pickle jar, threw his monitor at a wall but after having a 'big girl's night out', both of them recover quickly.</p>
									<p>He suffers from many ailments and phobias, including arachnophobia (fear of spiders), virgivitiphobia (fear of being sexually assaulted) and policophobia (fear of authorical figures), and suffers from asthma, myopia (short-sightedness) and a 'hot ear', which he cools down by spraying water onto. He has an extreme fear of going to prison, as he worries that the other prisoners will 'rape the flip out of [him]'.</p>
									<p>On his page on <a href="http://lonelyface.co.uk/">LonelyFaces.co.uk</a>, he lists his likes as computers, Masters of the Universe, Tek Wars, Magic the Darkening and Ferris Beuller's Day Off and his dislikes as football, most telly, non-computer things and the countryside.</p>
									<h5><strong>Skills and Abilities:</strong></h5>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Olfactory expert:</strong> Moss has an incredibly accute and detailed sense of smell, capable of smelling and naming all of the ingredients in a muffin and was able to smelling the rohypnol concealed in Jen's cup of tea.</li>
										<li><strong>Mathematician:</strong> Moss is a very capable mathematician and was able of calculating the amount of cigarettes Jen smokes per year in a matter of seconds with minimal information.</li>
										<li><strong>Computer expertise:</strong> Moss is incredibly experienced with computers and is was able to hack into Bill Crouse's personal accounts in a few of seconds. He is able to overcome viruses and repair firewalls, and also considers an amateuristic construction of a circuit board humourous.</li>
										<li><strong>Machinery Construction:</strong> Moss is quite skilled with machinery and technology in general, and was able to construct a 'stress machine' which could measure his stress level. He also helped Roy construct an answering machine.</li>
										<li><strong>'Five-Finger-Fillet':</strong> Moss is surprisingly talented at the 'five-finger-fillet', a game in which the player spreads their hand on a flat surface and, using a knife, stabs in between the gaps, trying not to stab their fingers. Moss performed this in order to test the stress machine he had construced and did so at a considerable speed without stabbing himself once.</li>
										<li><strong>Genius-level intellect:</strong> Moss is a genius with a vast amount of knowledge in the fields of technology, science and mathematics. He was also capable of memorising and reciting a 15-digit number seconds after hearing it for the first time.</li>
										<li><strong>Inventor and entrepreneur:</strong> Moss is an accomplished inventor, creating a revolutionary bra that will "never go bad," using a certain type and volume of powder. He pitched this invention on Dragon's Den, but the bra burst into flames (he failed to fix the overheating issue, only making it worse, something he jokes he could have done shortly before leaving for Dragon's Den) while being presented and so recieved no funding at all.</li>
