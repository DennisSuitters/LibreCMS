### FAQ
- Why no Plugins?
  - Anybody who's worked on or developed any kind of Content Mangement System in any Programming Language knows that Plugins are a potential security problem. Plugins are something that because third parties can build them, end up being out of the control of the developer, especially if the Plugin Maker disregards the conventions set by the project.
