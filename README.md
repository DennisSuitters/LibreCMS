![LibreCMS](core/images/librecms.png)  
a **Free** Open Source [MIT](https://github.com/DiemenDesign/LibreCMS/blob/master/LICENSE) Content Management System, that is built utilising [PHP](http://php.net/), PDO, [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and [LibreICONS](https://github.com/DiemenDesign/LibreICONS). Built to take advantage of HTML5 and CSS3, with necessary SEO attributes that fit in with Google's recommendations, Micro-formats, ARIA (A11Y), and general SEO Markup.

## LibreCMS is now Frozen, and will no longer be supported.
We will leave the repository here for those that wish to clone and continue, or even take over development.
We do however recommend if you want to use an English (Australian) Content Management System that we will continue to use and update, to head on over to [AuroraCMS](https://github.com/DiemenDesign/AuroraCMS).
